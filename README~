--Version 0.5beta--

The Three Little Pigs siri proxy server is an intelligent server with key throttling and database connection.
For tutorial how to run and get started please refer to instructions.txt


Features:

-MySql Database connection support: Supports MySQL database connection for storing configuration,keys and runtime statistics.

-Multiple key support and Key Throttling: You can connect more than 1 iPhone4S and store even more keys. The more the keys, the more the clients!

-Key Throttling: Each client uses a different key, if more than one Keys are available. The throttler makes sure that each Key is throttled thus enabling several client registration and assistant object creation.

-KeyLoad Safeguard: Never worry about how many people use your iPhone4S key. Each Key has a maximum keyload. Even when the key is still valid, if the keyload limit is exceeded, the safeguard disables the key and protects the iPhone4S from getting banned.

-KeyLoad Aware: Checks what key is not "Hot" anymore and periodically decreases the load, thus re-enabling Safeguarded Keys

-Web interface and monitoring: Always know what is happening without a CLI! With a web interface you can check statistics such as active connections, valid keys, server load, keyload etc.

-Bug Free (I hope...):-) Never worry if the server has crashed. Most of the bugs that were causing the server to crash are fixed now.
